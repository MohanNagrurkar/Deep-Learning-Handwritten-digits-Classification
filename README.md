# Deep-Learning-Handwritten-digits-Classification
Deep Learning Handwritten digits Classification using Neural Network.
In this small neural network project the handwritten digits are being identified. The dataset is taken from Keras Libraries which has 70,000 datapoints out of which 60,000 was taken for training purpose.
The model has being prepared based on two consideration. First with no hidden layer and second with one hidden layer.
The accuracy in both the cases was noted and the model with hidden layer gave the better accuracy results.
The model has been tested with various hyperparamenter tuning which is not included in this repository.


This deep learning project is from codebasics.
